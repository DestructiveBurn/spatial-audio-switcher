## üîí VirusTotal Verification (False Positives)
<details>
<summary><strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Important Security Note</strong></summary>

When compiling the AHK script to EXE, some antivirus engines may flag the output due to:

1. The nature of AutoHotkey's compiler (used by both legitimate and malicious software)
2. The program's ability to modify system audio settings
3. Common false positives with script-based utilities

**Key Points:**
- Windows Defender typically doesn't flag the compiled EXE
- Detection varies based on the compiled filename and compiler version
- You can verify safety by:
  - Reviewing the source code.
  - Compiling it yourself with [AutoHotkey v2+](https://www.autohotkey.com/)
  - Scanning with your preferred antivirus

I guarantee the code is clean - I wouldn't invest time improving unsafe software. These false positives are an unfortunate reality of script-based tools.

## VirusTotal

I've been working with the Spatial Audio Switcher.ahk, and when I compile it to an .exe using AutoHotKey Dash, I've noticed that some antivirus programs are incorrectly flagging the executables. While I haven't seen this issue with Windows Defender, there are definitely some false positives on VirusTotal. Changing the name during compilation alters the results on that site. I can assure you the code is clean. If you're curious, you can download AutoHotKey Dash and compile the Spatial Audio Switcher.ahk yourself to check what VirusTotal says.

I suspect that since this is a script-based tool builder, some users may have employed it for unusual purposes. Who knows? If it weren't safe, I wouldn't be dedicating my time to modding this application.
